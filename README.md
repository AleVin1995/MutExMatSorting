# MutExMatSorting
Mutual Exclusivity Sorting of Binary Matrices 

This package implements an heuristic algorithm that takes in input a sparse binary matrix and sorts its rows and columns in a way that the patterns of non-null entries have a minimal overlap across rows. This highlights possible mutual exclusive trends among these patterns.
